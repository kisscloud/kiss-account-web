# Cover

From ancient development time with jQuery to modern development with React/Vue, Dashboard management system is always focusing on data manipulation. Traditional back-end developers like use jQuery and template languages to create project. But with project complexity grow, It gets harder and harder to maintain page asset dependences and the codebase is not scaleable and I have to manually load bunch of scripts in every page, what a nightmare!

Now, it's golen age of front-end development. There has so many awesome frameworks(Vue.js/React/Angular) and tools(Webpack/Parcel) to help developers build complex project with maintainable and scaleable codebase. So I create **Cover** - a component library based on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

Itâ€™s simple, minimal core with carefully thought UI that can handle apps of any scale.

This documentation will walk through all the basic knowledge you needed to create your next web application.
